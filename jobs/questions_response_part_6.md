# How to Scale This Data Pipeline for Big Data

If we want this pipeline to handle very large volumes of data (terabytes or millions of files), here are the key points to consider:

##  1. Data Storage and Ingestion

- Use other file formats like **Parquet** or **Avro**.
- Add partitions (for example, by date) and clustering to organize the data and improve query performance.
- Process files **in parallel** using tools like **Spark**.

##  2. Pipeline Structure

- Split the pipeline into **small steps** that can be reused and tested.
- Use an **orchetrator** like **Airflow** / **Cloud workflows** to run the pipeline step by step.
- Add **error handling** and **logs** to know what happens if something goes wrong.

## 3. Data Processing

- Use **distributed tools** like **Spark** when data is too big for one machine for example in the traitement_ad_hook job.
- Process only **new data** instead of everything (DBT **incremental tables**).
- Use a simple structure with DBT/DATAFORM to manage the data instead of loading big files into Python:
    - **Bronze**: raw data
    - **Silver**: cleaned data
    - **Gold**: final data used for analysis or dashboards (Drug graph)

    Also:
    - Keep **old versions** (snapshots).
    - Use a **data catalog** (DBT generate docs) to document models.

## 5. Automation and DevOps

- Use tools like Terraform, Cloud Build, and Artifact Registry to create the necessary services.
- Add **tests** to check data quality.
- Use **different environments** (dev, test, prod) to avoid problems in production.

## Conclusion

To handle big data, we should:

- Use optimized file formats (like Parquet or Avro) and process data in parallel
- Only process new or changed data
- Automate and test each step
- Use separate environments for development, testing, and production
